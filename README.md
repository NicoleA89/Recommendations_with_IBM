#Recommendations with IBM

In this notebook, you will be putting your recommendation skills to use on real data from the IBM Watson Studio platform.

You may either submit your notebook through the workspace here, or you may work from your local machine and submit through the next page. Either way assure that your code passes the project RUBRIC. Please save regularly.

At the end of the notebook, you will find directions for how to submit your work. Let's get started by importing the necessary libraries and reading in the data.

## Part I : Exploratory Data Analysis
Use the dictionary and cells below to provide some insight into the descriptive statistics of the data.

## Part II: Rank-Based Recommendations
Unlike in the earlier lessons, we don't actually have ratings for whether a user liked an article or not. We only know that a user has interacted with an article. In these cases, the popularity of an article can really only be based on how often an article was interacted with.

## Part III: User-User Based Collaborative Filtering

## Part V: Matrix Factorization
In this part of the notebook, you will build use matrix factorization to make article recommendations to the users on the IBM Watson Studio platform.
